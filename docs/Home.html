TönnenKlapps (the final title) was a project made for Indie9000 (a Danish indie gamedevelopment competition held in Aalborg).
<br>
The theme for the competition was <a title="Fastelavn definition" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastelavn" target="_blank">
Fastelavn</a>, and we made a virtual tøndeslagning (barrelbeating - a tradition not entirely unlike beating a Piñata).</p>
<p>The game is played using XBox controllers. Participants try and beat the colored staves in a barrel at the correct moment, sort of a Guitar Hero version of Tøndeslagning.</p>
<p>The game was created by modelling a single staff for a barrel in a 3D drawing program. Then rotating it through 36 different positions.</p>

</p>
<p>When the game is played, the barrelstaves are given random colors (blue, green, red and yellow).</p>
<p>They are then drawn from back to front in their corresponding positions with a their hue.</p>
<p>The staves are then drawn in a new position with their old color, so it looks like the barrel is rotating.</p>

<p>The game allows players to add more controllers in the lobby, automatically detecting new controllers and assigning player numbers.</p>
<p>If you use our source code for something, please send us a copy – it would be fun to see where it goes :).</p>
